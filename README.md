Monero web payments.
A simple program that can provide monero payment processing to several backends.
It bundles a simple backend with monero-wallet-rpc, so it can do all kinds of stuff.
1. Verify signed messages.
2. Create a payment request.
3. Verify payment.
4. More functions to come

All via simple generic API. 

This should live right next to the website backend.
